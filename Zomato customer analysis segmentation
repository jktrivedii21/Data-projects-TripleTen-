1. Decomposition and Research Plan:
Research Area: Customer Analysis Segmentation
● Objective: Understand Zomato’s customer base by identifying distinct customer
segments and analyzing their purchasing behaviors.
● Key Questions to Answer:
1. Who are Zomato’s customers (demographics, location)?
2. What segments can customers be grouped into based on their behaviors?
3. How frequently do different segments order, and what is their average order
value?
4. What are the favorite cuisines or menu items for different segments?
5. Which segments have the highest customer retention and contribute the most to
revenue?
Hypotheses:
1. Younger customers (age 18-30) are more likely to order frequently, especially fast food
and convenience meals.
2. High-spending customers tend to order from premium restaurants more frequently.
3. Customers who frequently order from the same restaurant or cuisine type are more likely
to be retained over the long term.
Data Preparation and Feature Engineering:
● Clean and standardize the datasets (users.csv, orders.csv, menu.csv,
restaurant.csv).
● Create key metrics such as Order Frequency, Average Order Value, and Customer
Lifetime Value (CLV).
● Perform clustering to identify customer segments.
